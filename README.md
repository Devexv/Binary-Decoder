# Binary Decoder in C++

This is a simple console program written in C++ that decodes a binary string into its decimal equivalent.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/binary-decoder.git
    ```

2. **Compile the Program:**

    Navigate to the directory containing the source code (`binary_decoder.cpp`) and compile it using a C++ compiler. For example:

    ```
    g++ binary_decoder.cpp -o binary_decoder
    ```

3. **Run the Program:**

    Run the compiled program from the command line and follow the instructions:

    ```
    ./binary_decoder
    ```

4. **Enter Binary String:**

    Once the program is running, you will be prompted to enter a binary string containing only 0s and 1s.

5. **View Decimal Equivalent:**

    The program will then convert the entered binary string to its decimal equivalent and display the result.
